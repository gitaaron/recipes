# Recipe from Aunt Ruth
Rise  about 1 tlb of yeast in a bowl with 1/2 cup of luke warm water and a tsp of sugar.

In a big bowl put 1 1/2 shredded wheat,Shortening about the size of an egg,1/2 tlb of salt,1/2 cup of molasses.

Add 2 cups of real hot water over this and mix up and then add 1 cup of real cold water.

This should cool it down and then add yeast that has risen for 10 minutes.

Make sure it's not to hot as the yeast won't rise good.

Then add the flour as needed to form a ball and knead well.
