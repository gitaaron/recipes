1/2c almond flour
1/2c flax meal (I used golden flax meal; you could use either, I’m sure)
1/4c pumpkin
3 eggs
2T heavy cream
2T Torani Sugar Free Caramel Syrup (spoiler alert: couldn’t taste it, next time I’m using sucralose)
2T butter (I’m sure coconut oil would be good, also)
1t baking powder
1/4t salt
1/4t nutmeg
1/4t ground cloves
1/2t cinnamon (you could just use pumpkin pie spice, but I didn’t have any on hand so I measured out the individual spices)
I also used 1 serving of dark chocolate chips
