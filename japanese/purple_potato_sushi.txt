2 medium sized purple sweet potatoes
1 red bell pepper (optional)*
1 yellow bell pepper (optional)*
4 oz wild-caught, sashimi-grade salmon
1 avocado
1 cucumber
2 Nori sheets
Sushi mat
Pink Himalayan sea salt
Brain Octane Oil or MCT oilInstructions
Steam the purple sweet potato until soft (the skin will easily come off). While the sweet potato is steaming, cut the veggies and salmon into thin slices.
Once the sweet potato is done steaming, strip off the skin and mash the potato.
Once cooled, spread out a nori sheet over a sushi mat. Spread the sweet potato over the entire nori sheet.
Pile your veggies and salmon in the middle of the nori sheet and roll up as tightly as possible. It will look like a sushi burrito.
Transfer the sushi roll onto a cutting board and slice into sushi pieces. Make sure youâ€™re using an extra-sharp knife to keep the roll intact.
Drizzle with Brain Octane Oil and top with pink Himalayan sea salt.
