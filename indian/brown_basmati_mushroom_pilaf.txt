# Brown Basmata portobello mushroom pilaf

## Rice
---A
- 2-3 Tbsp butter or cooking oil
---B
- 1.5 tsp cumin seeds (optional)
---C
- 1 large onion, finely chopped
---D
- 2 cups brown basmati rice, rinced twice and drained under cold water
- 4 cups water or 950 ml of chicken stock
- 1 tsp salt

A - In a large pot, melt butter on medium (or heat oil on medium-high for about 1 minute). 

B - Add cumin seeds and allow them to sizzle for 15 seconds. 

C - Add onion and sauté until browned, about 10 minutes. (The less you sauté the onions, the sweeter they will taste; the more you sauté them, the more they will have a toasty, roasted flavour.)

D -
Add water (or stock) and salt to the pot, then add rice. Using your hands, scrape rice grains from the bowl into the pot. Stir well, increase the heat to high and bring to a boil.
Immediately reduce the heat to a simmer, cover and simmer for 35 minutes.
The cooking time for the rice will vary from stove to stove, so remove the lid and check for water.
If there is no extra water in the pot, carefully taste the rice to see if it’s cooked through.
If it’s not, put the lid back on, turn off the heat and allow the rice to cook in its steam for another 15 minutes.
Or, add 1/2 cup more water and continue simmering for 10 minutes.
If there is still extra water in the pot after 40 minutes, cook rice, covered, for another 10 minutes.
Turn off the heat, keep the lid on the pot and allow rice to sit for 5 minutes before serving.
If you like your rice firmer, serve it immediately once you have turned off the heat.


## Mushrooms
---A
- 2-3 Tbsp cooking oil

---B
- 1 Tbsp cumin seeds

---C
- 1 Tbsp finely chopped garlic (3 medium cloves)

---D
- 1/2 medium tomato, chopped
- 1 tsp salt
- 1 tsp black pepper or ground cayenne pepper (optional)
- 1 tsp dried green fenugreek leaves

---E
- 10 oz portobello mushrooms, cut in 1-inch slices


A - In a medium frying pan, heat oil on medium-high for 45 seconds. 

B - Sprinkle in cumin seeds and allow them to sizzle for 15 to 30 seconds, or until dark brown. 

C - Add garlic and sauté for 2 minutes, or until golden brown. 

D - Stir in tomato. Add salt, black pepper (or cayenne) and fenugreek leaves, stir well and sauté for 1 minute. 

E - Add mushrooms and stir well. Reduce the heat to medium and continue cooking for 2-4 minutes, or until mushrooms release water. 
(When you first add the mushrooms and stir, the masala may stick to the pan and it will look messy. This will all change when they release water.) 
As soon as mushrooms become slightly wilted, turn off the heat so that you don’t overcook them. Set aside until the rice is cooked. Pour mushrooms into cooked rice. 
Spoon a quarter cup of rice into the frying pan and stir it around to soak up all the garlic and spices. Pour this rice back into the rest of the mushroom-rice mixture and stir well to combine.
