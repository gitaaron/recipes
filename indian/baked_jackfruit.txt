# Baked Jackfruit

---A
6 Tbsp fennel seeds or 1 Tbsp garam masala
---B
two 18-oz cans jackfruit, drained
---C
1/3 cup cooking oil
1 tsp paprika
1/2 tsp ground cayenne pepper
1 Tbsp + 1 tsp finely chopped garlic (4 medium cloves)
1/2 tsp salt


A. Heat 10-inch heavy bottom pan on high for 1 min.
   Add fennel seeds, and, stirring regularly, cook for 2-3 min., or until slightly darker.
   Pour onto plate and cool for 20 min.
   Grind seeds in coffee grinder.
   Set aside 1 tsp. for this recipe and store rest in airtight container for use in other recipes.

B. Place jackfruit in tea towel and gently rub to dry then transfer to bowl; pre-heat oven to 450 ℉

C. In large bowl combine oil, fennel, paprika, cayenne, garlic, salt.
   Add jackfrui and mix well.
   Spread over cooking sheet and spoon any leftover sauce over jackfruit.
   Bake on the middle rack for 15 minutes.
   Jackfruit should be sizzling and have a nice gloss from the oil (if jackfruit is directly on the baking sheet,
   there will be some light charring on the pieces).
   One sign that jackfruit is cooked is that some threads of jackfruit will have separated and are sticking out.
   If no threads are visible and jackfruit hasn’t charred, bake for another 5 minutes.
   Threads or no threads, remove jackfruit from the oven.
