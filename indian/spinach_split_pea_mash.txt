#Spinach and Split Pea Mash
A---
1.5 cups green split peas
3.5 cups water
B---
1/4 cup cooking oil or ghee
C---
1 cup finely chopped onion (1 medium)
D---
1.5 Tbsp finely chopped garlic (4-5 med cloves)
E---
2.5 Tbsp or less chopped jalapeno pepper (1 large)
1 tsp salt
7-8 oz fresh spinach (1 bunch) with stems
G---
1 Tbsp ground sumac
2 tsp dried mint

A.  Place split peas in a colander and wash and drain them several times to remove any dirt, rocks and other impurities. Transfer split peas to a medium pot, cover them with the 3 1/2 cups water and soak for 2 hours. Bring split peas and water to a boil on high heat. Reduce the heat to low, cover and simmer for 15 to 20 minutes. Most of the water should have been absorbed, but the peas should be cooked and moist with a little water still in the pot. Cook longer or drain if there is too much water in the pot.  Remove from the heat and allow to cool for 30 minutes. 

B.  In a medium frying pan, heat oil (or ghee) on medium-high for 45 seconds. 

C.  Add onion and sauté for 5 minutes, or until golden.

D.  Add garlic and continue to sauté for 2 to 3 minutes, or until golden. 

E.  Add jalapeño pepper, salt and spinach. Stir well and cook for 1 minute, or until spinach wilts. 

F.  Set aside to cool for 15 minutes.

G.  Once the split pea and spinach mixtures have cooled, purée each one separately in a food processor. 
Process split peas until smooth, spinach until roughly puréed and slightly chunky. 
In a medium bowl, combine peas and spinach. Stir in sumac and mint. Will keep refrigerated in an airtight container for 4 to 5 days.
