## Tips
1. Half cook the cauliflower and potatoes before adding it to the onion-tomato masala. You can parboil the potatoes and cauliflower or do what I did – fry them in little oil till they are half cooked. This helps in retaining the shape and texture.

2. Don’t cover and cook the cauliflower, you can cover towards the end and cook on low flame only.

3. Add salt towards the end when the dish is almost done.


## Method

A. Heat 2 teaspoon of oil in a pan on medium heat. Add cauliflower florets and fry for 2-3 minutes and then add the sliced potatoes.
   Fry on medium-low flame for 7-8 minutes till potatoes and cauliflower have some brown spots on them.
   Drain on a tissue paper and set aside.


B. In the same pan heat 1.5 teaspoon of oil on medium heat and add cumin seeds and let them crackle.

C. Add the onions and cook for 2 minutes or till onion is translucent.

D. Add the ginger-garlic paste.  Cook for another 2 minutes or till the raw smell of ginger and garlic goes away.

E. Add the chopped tomatoes.  Cook for 2 minutes till tomatoes are little soft.

F. Once the tomatoes are little soft, add turmeric powder, red chilli powder, coriander powder and amchur (mango powder). Cover the pan and let the masala cook for 2-3 minutes.

G. Now add the potatoes and cauliflower to it and mix.

H. Add chopped coriander leaves, garam masala and give a good mix.  Saute on medium-low heat for 5-6 minutes.

J. Add salt and cover the pan and cook for additional 6-7 minutes on low flame or till the potato and cauliflower are tender but not soggy.
   If you feel the masala is sticking, you may add some water.
   Add 1 tablespoon at a time and only add enough to cook the veggies. I did not add any water in mine.

K. Garnish with some more coriander leaves.
