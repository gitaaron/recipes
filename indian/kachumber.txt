1 tablespoon finely chopped Coriander Leaves
1 Green Chilli, finely chopped
1 teaspoon Lemon Juice
1/4 teaspoon Black Pepper Powder

2. Add lemon juice, black pepper, green chilli, coriander leaves and salt. Toss gently until all ingredients are mixed well.
3. Taste for seasoning and add more salt or lemon juice if required. Kachumber salad is ready.

## tips
- If you want to prepare salad few hours before serving to avoid last minute rush, then chop all vegetables except onion and keep them in refrigerator. Mix chopped onion, salt and other spices just before the serving.
- Use shredded cabbage in place of chopped one and use vinegar in place of lemon juice for a different taste.
- Sprinkle shredded beetroot over salad to give it a special look.
