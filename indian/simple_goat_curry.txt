2 Tbsp ground cumin
2 tsp ground coriander
1 tsp turmeric

1/2 cup chopped fresh cilantro

A.  Heat oil in large, heavy stockpot on med.-high for 1 min.
B.  Add onions and saute until slightly dark brown (9-10 min.)
C.  Add garlic and saute until golden brown (2-3 min.)
NOTE: onion should be dark brown but not black
D.  Reduce heat to med.  Stir in ginger and spices and cook until oil separates  (3-5 min.)
NOTE: add another tsp of oil to deglaze if necessary
E.  Add goat meat, stir well and saute for 3-4 min.
F.  Stir in tomatoes and cook 3-4 min.
G.  Pour in sour cream & water mixture.  Stir well then increase heat to med-high and bring to a boil.
H.  Reduce the heat to med.-low and cover with a heavy lid.  Simmer for 30 min then remove lid and stir.
The meat should be simmering in the soup.  If there is not enough liquid, add one more cup of water.  
I.  Replace the lid and continue cooking for and additional 45 min.
K.  Remove a piece of meat from the pot and allow it to cool.  Taste it to see if it is tender.
If not done, cook for additional 30-45 min.  Once goat meat is cooked, turn off the heat.
NOTE: as long as there is still liquid in the pot, don't worry about over cooking the goat.  It will just become more tender.
L.  Mix in cilantro before serving.
