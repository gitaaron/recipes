B.  Add ginger, salt, turmeric, cumin, coriander, cayenne, cloves and cinammon.
  Saute 3-4 min.

C.  Reduce heat to low and mix in cauliflower.  Gently stir so tomato masala covers cauliflower.
  Increase heat to medium and saute 8-10 min stirring once halfway through.  
  If cauliflower is not cooking then increase heat.
  If its sticking to the bottom of the pan decrease heat.
  Pierce one large piece to see if cauliflower is soft (not mushy)
