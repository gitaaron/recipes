4 large eggs, free-range or organic
4 tbsp extra virgin coconut oil or butter (grass-fed), melted
4 tbsp heavy whipping cream or coconut milk (30 ml / 1.1 fl oz)
1/2 cup pumpkin purée, BPA-free, canned or home-made (50g / 1.8 oz)
1 scoop whey protein powder, vanilla or plain (artificial additives and hormone free) or use more coconut flour (+ ½ - 1 tbsp)
3 tbsp coconut flour (18g / 0.6 oz)
2 tsp pumpkin pie spice mix (you can make your own)
1/2 tsp baking soda
3 tbsp maple syrup
1/2 cup raisins
optional: 1/2 cup crème fraîche / sour cream / plain full fat yogurt or coconut cream (60g / 2.2 oz)


Crack the eggs into a bowl and whisk them with melted coconut oil, Erythritol and Stevia.
Add the pumpkin purée and process until smooth.
Pour in the cream (or coconut milk) and mix well.
Add protein powder, coconut flour, baking soda and the gingerbread spice mix.
Preheat the waffle maker, typically, in the closed position. Do not pour the batter in until it's heated according to the manufacturer's instructions.
Close the waffle maker and cook for a minute or two. Time depends on the waffle maker.
When done, place on a serving plate and enjoy!
